# Karatsauba-Multiplier-for-N-bits-using-radix-4-Booth-multiplier--Verilog
The repository has verilog implementation of karatsauba alogrithm, integrated with radix-4 Booth Multiplier. The objective of project is to Design a multiplier that dont use any DSP and give a fair performance and a limited number of Luts.
